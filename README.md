# Data Distribution on Scalable System, Chord Method

Improve the the chord method to distribute data more efficiently on a scalable system. Chord protocol was implemented in the C language and dispersed using docker. The program measures and prints time
taken for node joining and stabilized operation. It compares both methods and showcases to the user which distributed data faster in a trial run.
 
# Research findings

Simplified basic Chord Distributed Hash Table (DHT), which is a structured peer-to-peer system for distributed lookups. Implements finger tables, node joining, stabilization, and successor/predecessor maintenance using mutex locks for thread safety.
